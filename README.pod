Perl::Metrics::Lite - Pluggable Perl Code Metrics System

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Perl::Metrics::Lite;
  my $analzyer   = Perl::Metrics::Lite->new;
  my $analysis   = $analzyer->analyze_files(@ARGV);
  my $file_stats = $analysis->file_stats;
  my $sub_stats = $analysis->sub_stats;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Perl::Metrics::Lite> is the pluggable perl code metrics system.

B<Perl::Metrics::Lite> provides just enough methods to run static analysis
of one or many Perl files and obtain a few metrics.

B<Perl::Metrics::Lite> is far simpler than L<Perl::Metrics> 
and more extensible than L<Perl::Metrics::Simple>.

=head1 USAGE

See the F<measureperl> and F<measureperl-checkstyle>  script 
(included with this distribution) for a simple example of usage.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new

Takes no arguments and returns a new L<Perl::Metrics::Lite> object.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 analyze_files( @paths, @refs_to_file_contents )

Takes an array of files and or directory paths, and/or
SCALAR refs to file contents and returns
an L<Perl::Metrics::Lite::Analysis> object.
